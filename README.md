# Territory

A fast-paced multiplayer territory-conquest game built with React.

Expand your territory, draw trails outside your borders, capture new land, and eliminate opponents before they eliminate you. Inspired by classic territory-control arcade games, **Territory** combines strategic expansion, risk management, and competitive survival.

## Gameplay

Each player starts with a small territory.

To expand:

1. Leave your territory.
2. Draw a trail through neutral space.
3. Return safely to your own territory.
4. The enclosed area becomes yours.

Be careful:

* If another player crosses your active trail, you are eliminated.
* Crossing your own trail before reconnecting to your territory can be fatal.
* Holding more than 50% of the playable map for 30 seconds triggers a domination victory.
